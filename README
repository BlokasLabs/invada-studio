INSTALLATION
============
No binaries are included, you'll need to compile the plugins yourself. 



BUILDING
========
To build the plugins the you'll need the following items installed:
* a working build environment with core includes
* the lv2 header file (lv2.h)
* the gtk2 developer libraries & includes
* the cairo developer libraries & includes
* the glade2 developer libraries & includes

Go to the directory that was created when you unpacked this archive and then run:

make
make install-user (to install in ~/.lv2)
or
make install-sys (as root to install in /usr/local/lib/lv2)

Change the Makefile if you'd like to have them in an alternate system location.



BUILDING (Debian and derivatives)
=================================
Packages for Debian and derivatives (Ubuntu etc) can be built from this archive. You'll need a Debian build environment.
To install the build environment and dependancies run the following:

sudo apt-get install build-essential debhelper fakeroot lv2core libgtk2.0-dev

Go to the directory that was created when you unpacked this archive and then run:

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -tc

Once done you'll find a 'deb' package for your system in the directory above. Use your favourite package manager to install.
The plugins will install into "/usr" by default. 



PACKAGES (Ubuntu and derivatives)
=================================
Pre built binary packagaes for ubuntu are available from https://launchpad.net/~invada/+archive/ppa



PACKAGING FOR DISTROS
=================================
An alternative download is available at launchpad which has no 'debian' packaging information in it. Look for the 'nopkg' tarball.
When building in fakeroot type environments, the installation directory can be prefixed with a destination directory like so:
make install-sys DESTDIR='/a/fake/root/location'
which will install into /a/fake/root/location/usr/local/lib/lv2



Enjoy!
