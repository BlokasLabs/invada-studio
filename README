INSTALLATION
============
No binaries are included, you'll need to compile the plugins yourself. 



BUILDING
========
To build the plugins the you'll need the following items installed:
* a working build environment with core includes
* the lv2 header file (lv2core.h)
* the gtk2 developer libraries & includes
* the cairo developer libraries & includes
* the glade2 developer libraries & includes

Go to the directory that was created when you unpacked this archive and then run:

make
make install-user (to install in ~/.lv2)
[as root] make install-sys (to install in /usr/local/lib/lv2)

Change the Makefile if you'd like to have them in an alternate system location



BUILDING (Debian and derivatives)
=================================
Packages for Debian and derivatives (Ubuntu etc) can be built from this archive. You'll need a Debian build environment.
To install the build environment and dependancies run the following:

sudo apt-get install build-essential debhelper fakeroot libgtk2.0-dev

Go to the directory that was created when you unpacked this archive and then run:

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -tc

Once done you'll find a 'deb' package for your system in the directory above. Use your favourite package manager to install.
The plugins will install into "/usr" by default.
